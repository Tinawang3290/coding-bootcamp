## What is a computer and what is programming?

This lecture introduces the concept of a computer (from a programmer's perspective), and then also introduces the idea of _programming_. This is a set of slides, and pdf is uploaded here. The google slides link to the presentation is below:

To get introduced to programming in a fun way, I've also created [this document](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture1/logo_programming.md) which introduced the Logo programming language.
