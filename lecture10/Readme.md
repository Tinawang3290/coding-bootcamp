## Building web applications using Flask

[This lecture](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture10/webapp.md) is essentially a tutorial to help you learn how to build web applications and deploy them on the internet for everyone to use. We use a popular web developlment framework called **Flask** to build websites.

There is a [quiz](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture10/quiz.md) which is helpful in reinforcing concepts learned in this lecture and a couple of previous lectures.

Finally, there are a couple of assignments:
- [Dictionary](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture10/assignment_dictionary.md)
- [Photo filters](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture10/assignment_photo_filters.md)

These assignments are full websites, and requires to learn more concepts on top of what we covered in the tutorial. For new programmers looking to switch careers, these assignments are projects worthy to be included in your portfolio, especially if personalize them by adding new features or making them look professional.
