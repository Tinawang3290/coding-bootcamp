# Functions and recursion

[This lecture](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture4/functions.md) introduces the concept of functions in Python. Other than Python specific details on functions, this lecture also focuses on *Recursion*, which is a very powerful programming technique. Half the assignments in the set below are designed with recursion based solutions in mind.

The assignments for this lecture are available at [this link](https://repl.it/data/classrooms/share/9eafa8dd60005b631d3e06159e4d1f87). You will need to sign up for [repl.it](https://repl.it) (don't check "I'm a teacher" when you sign up) before you click on the link above to join the "classroom" where you can attempt assignments.
