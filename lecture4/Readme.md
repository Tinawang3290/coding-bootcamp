# Functions and recursion

[This lecture](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture4/functions.md) introduces the concept of functions in Python. Other than Python specific details on functions, this lecture also focuses on *Recursion*, which is a very powerful programming technique. Half the assignments in the set below are designed with recursion based solutions in mind.

There is also a [quiz](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture4/quiz.md) which you can attempt. This quiz is designed to test your understanding of concepts learned in lectures 2-4.

The assignments for this lecture are available at [this link](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/QU4L6OS). You will need to sign up for [repl.it](https://repl.it) (don't check "I'm a teacher" when you sign up) before you click on the link above to join the "classroom" where you can attempt assignments.

The assignments, along with solutions, are [also listed here](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture4/assignments.md). If you're looking at the solution, make sure either you've already solved the problem, or tried hard.
