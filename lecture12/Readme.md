## Web applications with user accounts

[This lecture](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture12/user_accounts.md) first gives some grounding on what is needed to build apps that have user accounts. It also discusses fundamental aspects of security. It then uses the `Flask-login` module to build a writer app which allows users to read and rite articles on the website and follow their favorite authors.
 
 There are no separate assignments for this lecture. There are exercises which are part of the lecture which are required if you want to build a functioning app.
