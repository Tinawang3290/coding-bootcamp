## Testing

[This lecture](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture13/testing.md) teaches you how to write tests for your code. Testing is a fundamental programming skill and typically a programmer spends a large portion of their time writing tests.

There are no assignments, but I highly encourage you to try the examples showed in the lecture yourself.
