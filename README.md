# Coding bootcamp

This is the material that is used for the [free coding bootcamp](https://www.meetup.com/SF-Free-Coding-Bootcamp/) meetup that I run in SF. The material contains a collection of lectures, assignments and occasional quizzes.

This bootcamp **uses Python as the language of choice** to introduce programming. It's a very popular language and is being used more and more frequently for production systems - including webserver frameworks, data analysis and machine learning.

The material is organized by lecture. The Readme inside every lecture directory contains the details about that lecture.
