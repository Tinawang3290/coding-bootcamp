# Modules

[This lecture](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture7/modules.md) introduces the concept of modules and shows how to use some modules from the Python Standard Library and third party modules.

The assignments are [listed here](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture7/assignments.md). This set of assignments is quite advanced, so take your time on each one.
