# Collection Types and For Loop

[This lecture](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture5/collections_forloop.md) introduces the list, tuple and dictionary types in Python which can store collections of data. It also introduces the `for` statement, which is a much more convenient way to create loops when compared to the `while` statement.
