# Collection Types and For Loop

[This lecture](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture5/collections_forloop.md) introduces the list, tuple and dictionary types in Python which can store collections of data. It also introduces the `for` statement, which is a much more convenient way to create loops when compared to the `while` statement.

The assignments for this lecture are available at [this link](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/US0qbyU). You will need to sign up for [repl.it](https://repl.it) (don't check "I'm a teacher" when you sign up) before you click on the link above to join the "classroom" where you can attempt assignments.

As an application of the concepts learnt in this lecture, there is an additional tutorial which takes some real life data (about the California public school system) and tries to answer some questions about the schools in CA. That tutorial can be [seen here](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture5/data_analysis.md). It also have a bunch of exercises.
