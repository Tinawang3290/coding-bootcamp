## Using Databases for Web Applications

[This lecture](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture11/webapp_using_db.md) builds on what we learnt in the last lecture about web development using Flask. We learn about databases, and how to develop websites which use a DB as a backend for data store. In the latter half of the lecture, we also look into form validation and sanitizing form input for security.

By following this tutorial, you will create a *Quiz webapp* that allows one to add questions to a data store, and then users can take a quiz which includes all those questions, and get to know how well they did.

The [assignment](https://github.com/amangup/coding-bootcamp/blob/master/lecture11/assignments.md) asks you to extend that app further by adding features like questions on multiple subjects and having a leaderboard.
